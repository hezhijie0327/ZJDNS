## ‚ú® Features

### üîß Core Features

- **Recursive DNS Resolution**: Complete implementation of DNS recursive query algorithm, resolving step by step from root servers
- **Smart Root Server Management**: Automatically manages 13 IPv4 and 13 IPv6 root servers, dynamically sorts based on real-time network latency testing, prioritizing optimal servers for queries
- **Intelligent Protocol Negotiation**: Supports both UDP and TCP protocols, **automatically falls back to TCP protocol when UDP responses are truncated or exceed buffer size**, ensuring complete transmission of large response data
- **CNAME Chain Resolution**: Intelligently handles CNAME record chains, prevents circular references, supports multi-level CNAME resolution
- **Concurrent Queries**: High-performance concurrent processing with connection pool management
- **DNS Rewrite Functionality**: Supports exact match domain rewrite rules, enabling domain filtering and redirection; supports custom response codes (such as NXDOMAIN, SERVFAIL, etc.) and DNS records (such as A, AAAA, CNAME, etc.) return
- **Hybrid Mode**: Can configure both upstream DNS servers and recursive resolvers simultaneously, enabling flexible query strategies
- **Network Quality-Aware Sorting**: Performs network latency testing on resolution results and sorts by quality, prioritizing results with the best network quality

### üõ°Ô∏è Security and Defense Features

- **CIDR Filtering**: Intelligent IP address filtering based on CIDR rules, supporting precise result control.
  - **File Configuration**: Define CIDR rules through external files, supporting dynamic loading and management.
  - **Label Matching**: Use label system to associate upstream servers with filtering rules, enabling flexible policy configuration.
  - **Record Filtering**: Intelligently filter A and AAAA records, only allowing IP results that comply with CIDR rules to pass through.
  - **Rejection Policy**: When any record is filtered, returns REFUSED response, ensuring strict access control.
- **DNS Hijacking Prevention**: Proactively detects and intelligently responds to overreaching responses from root servers.
  - **Step 1**: When detecting that root servers directly return final records for non-root domains, it's determined as DNS hijacking.
  - **Step 2**: **Automatically switches to TCP protocol for retry** to bypass common UDP pollution.
  - **Step 3**: If TCP query results are **still** hijacked, completely reject the response, preventing pollution from the source.
- **DNSSEC Validation**: Complete DNSSEC support and validation, can set server mandatory validation, supports AD flag propagation
- **ECS Support**: EDNS Client Subnet, providing geolocation-aware resolution, supports `auto`, `auto_v4`, `auto_v6` auto-detection or manual CIDR configuration
- **Recursion Depth Protection**: Prevents malicious recursive query attacks, configurable maximum recursion depth

### üîê Secure Transport Protocols

- **DNS over TLS (DoT)**: Supports standard DNS over TLS protocol (RFC 7818), providing encrypted DNS queries on port `853`, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.
- **DNS over QUIC (DoQ)**: Supports cutting-edge DNS over QUIC protocol, leveraging QUIC protocol's 0-RTT, multiplexing, and connection migration features to provide lower latency and higher reliability encrypted DNS services.
- **DNS over HTTPS (DoH/DoH3)**: Simultaneously supports HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 DoH services, providing HTTPS-based DNS queries on port `443`.
- **Unified Certificate Management**: DoT, DoQ, and DoH share the same TLS certificate configuration, simplifying deployment.
- **Self-signed CA Support**: Built-in self-signed CA functionality, can dynamically sign TLS certificates for domains, simplifying development environment configuration.
- **Debug Certificate Auto-generation**: Automatically generates self-signed TLS certificates in development or debug mode, no external certificate files required.
- **Enhanced TLS Logging**: Provides detailed TLS handshake and certificate validation logs, facilitating problem diagnosis and security monitoring.

### üîß TLS Certificate Management

- **Self-signed Root CA**: Built-in self-signed root certificate authority, supports signing TLS certificates for any domain.
- **Dynamic Certificate Issuance**: Can dynamically generate valid TLS certificates based on configured domains, no external certificate files required.
- **Development Debug Support**: Automatically generates temporary certificates in development environments, simplifying configuration process.
- **EC Key Support**: Supports generation, serialization, and loading of ECDSA private keys, providing more modern encryption algorithms.
- **Certificate Validation Logs**: Detailed TLS certificate validation process logs, including certificate chain validation, validity period checks, etc.

### üì¶ DNS Padding

- **RFC 7830 Standard Support**: Implements DNS Padding functionality, standardizing DNS response packet sizes by adding padding bytes in EDNS0, effectively combating fingerprinting and censorship based on traffic size.
- **Smart Block Size Padding**: Pads to recommended 468 bytes, balancing privacy protection and bandwidth efficiency.
- **On-demand Enablement**: Can be flexibly enabled or disabled through configuration file, **only effective for secure connections (DoT/DoQ/DoH)**.

### üìç DDR (Discovery of Designated Resolvers) Functionality

- **Auto-discovery Support**: Supports RFC [9461](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9461.html)/[9462](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9462.html) DNS SVCB records for automatic discovery of secure DNS servers
- **SVCB Record Generation**: Automatically generates SVCB records for DoT, DoH, DoQ, supporting IPv4 and IPv6 hints
- **Flexible Configuration**: Specify DDR domain names and corresponding IP addresses through configuration file, supporting IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack configuration
- **Intelligent Response**: When receiving SVCB queries for `_dns.resolver.arpa`, `_dns.dns.example.org`, `_non_53_port._dns.dns.example.org`, automatically returns configured encrypted DNS service information

### üöÄ Network Quality Testing (SpeedTest)

- **Multi-protocol Support**: Supports various protocols including ICMP, TCP, and UDP for network quality testing
- **Flexible Configuration**: Configurable different test ports and timeout values, adapting to different network environments
- **Intelligent Sorting**: Sorts DNS resolution results by latency based on test results, prioritizing results with the best network quality
- **Caching Mechanism**: Built-in test result caching, avoiding duplicate tests and improving response speed
- **Concurrent Processing**: Supports concurrent testing of multiple IP addresses, improving test efficiency

### üíæ Cache System

- **Dual Mode Operation**:
  - **No Cache Mode**: Suitable for testing environments, zero-configuration startup, pure recursive resolution
  - **Redis Cache Mode**: Recommended for production environments, supports distributed deployment, data persistence
- **Intelligent TTL Management**: Flexible TTL strategies, supports minimum/maximum TTL limits
- **Stale Cache Serving**: Provides stale cache service when upstream servers are unavailable, greatly improving system availability
- **Prefetch Mechanism**: Background automatic refresh of soon-to-expire cache, reducing user waiting time
- **ECS-aware Caching**: Cache partitioning based on client geographic location (EDNS Client Subnet), providing precise localized resolution
- **Access Throttling**: Throttles cache access time update operations, reducing Redis pressure

### üïµÔ∏è Request Tracking System

- **Full-chain Tracing**: Generates unique ID for each DNS request, detailed recording of each step and time consumption during processing.
- **Intelligent Logging**: At `DEBUG` level, outputs timestamped request processing steps, greatly simplifying debugging and performance analysis.
- **Summary Report**: At `INFO` level, outputs request processing summary, including cache hit status, total time, upstream servers used, and other key information.
